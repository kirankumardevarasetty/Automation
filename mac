1. Open a text editor and paste the following Python script:
2. Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `jenkins_health_check.py`.

3. Create a text file named `jenkins_urls.txt` in the same directory as the script. Put each Jenkins URL on a separate line in this file.

4. Open Terminal on your Mac.

5. Navigate to the directory where you saved the script and the `jenkins_urls.txt` file.

6. Run the script by typing `python jenkins_health_check.py` and pressing Enter.

The script will check the status of each Jenkins URL listed in `jenkins_urls.txt` and send an email alert if any of the services are not running. Make sure to replace `"your_email@example.com"`, `"your_password"`, and `"smtp.example.com"` with your email credentials and SMTP server details.
